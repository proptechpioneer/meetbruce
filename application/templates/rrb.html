                                        For the first time, all private rented homes must meet a clear minimum quality standard. Local councils will have new powers to take action if your home falls below these standards, ensuring better living conditions for everyone.

                                The Renters' Rights Act represents a major step forward for tenants, offering more security, fairness, and quality in the private rented sector. Whether you're worried about unfair evictions, unpredictable rent hikes, discrimination, or poor housing conditions, the new law is designed to give you more control and peace of mind. As each phase is introduced, tenants will see real improvements in their renting experience—making rented homes better, safer, and fairer for everyone.
